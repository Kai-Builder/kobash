# Start 1.0

Libraries are the things that make koBash Better. If you don't have Libraries Installed, Excluding Sudok, What are you coding?

# Start 1.3

It is simple to make your own Library through kobash, But not KoBash standalone. You Must Have these Libraries.

- Pygo
- Operion
- KoBashToolKit 1.0.x



# Start 1.5

While Inside the prompt, Type

```python
sudok install PyGo
```

```
sudok install operion
```

```
sudok install kobashkit
```

# Start 1.8



Now you have installed The Recommended libraries.  You May also build from source. 



# Beginning 2.0

If you have a older version (1.0-1.0.3)

```
from KoBashToolkit.sharedtoolkits.buildTools.cus import *
```



If you have the latest Version (1.1.+)

```
from addons.PyGo import *
from addons.operion import *
from addons.KoBashToolKit import *
```

The reason I Did this was to fix Some Import Issues and python issues with Some Bugs which will be fixed in 1.1.0, Trust me



# Beginning 2.3

You're ready to go! First thing to do is build A Scripting Handler.

You can do this my going to the folder, Open the folder in a IDE.

Create `Handler.py`. Very Simply.

```python
from KoBashToolkit.sharedtoolkits.buildTools.cus import *
from addons.KoBashToolKit.toolkitscripts import *
from addons.operion.OperionLib import *
from addons.PyGo.pygo_class import * # Functions Is not The Functions we will be using
```

The PyGo Class Module Makes a pre Printed Message, Allowing the User to access the PYGO Console. You Can Put a pygo console in. It is recommended.

```python
time.sleep(3) # Pause and let user read PYGO start message.
BuildTools.NewPlugin() # addon.json
BuildTools.LoadingSequence(1) # One Is the Default Message. Will Fallback If no number specified. Supported integers, 1,2,3,4,5.
BuildTools.EnCryp() # Safely Create Addon.
```

Now you did it! You made your First Addon! Technically.



# End 2.9
